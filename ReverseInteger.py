Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
